        <p><strong>Battle of Cuautla(1911) -</strong> This battle has been described as "six of the most terrible days of battle in the whole Revolution". Emiliano Zapata and his army attacked the town of cuautla where the Golden fifth were stationad. Eventually,
          the remains of the defending Golden Fifth regiment, the Fifth Cavalry Regiment of the Federal Army, withdrew and Zapata took control of the town. The Zapatista victory convinced Porfirio Díaz to come to terms with Francisco Madero, agree to
          the Treaty of Ciudad Juárez and resign as president.</p>

        <p><strong>Plan of ayala(November 1911)-</strong>The Plan of Ayala (Spanish: Plan de Ayala) was a document written by Mexican Revolution leader Emiliano Zapata and his supporters in November of 1911, in response to Francisco I. Madero and his Plan
          of San Luís. The plan is a denunciation of Madero as well as a manifesto of Zapatismo and what it stood for. It calls for land reform and freedom, and would become very important to Zapata's movement until his assassination in 1919.</p>

        <p><strong>Convention of Aguascalientes(1914)-</strong>This convention was intended to settle the differences between the "big four" warlords who played the biggest roles in overthrowing Huerta: Pancho Villa, Emiliano Zapata, Venustiano Carranza
          and Alvaro Obregon. From the onset, however, the Convention was dominated by the Villistas, who imposed their points of view on the other delegates. The supporters of Emiliano Zapata did not arrive until 26 October (a delegation of 26, led by
          Paulino Martínez and Antonio Díaz Soto y Gama). The Convention declared itself sovereign, elected General Eulalio Gutiérrez Ortiz as President of Republic, and appointed Villa commander of the Conventionalist Army, which then took up arms against
          Carranza's Constitutionalists. Due to the disagreements that Carranza had with Zapata and Villa, the three refused to attend the convention and little developed as a result. After the meeting, the newly reconciled Villa and Zapata entered Mexico
          City on 6 December, at the head of an army of 60,000 men. Carranza and his supporters consequently fled to Veracruz.</p>
